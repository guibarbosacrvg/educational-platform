# Educational Platform Project Plan

## 1. Project Definition and Scope
- **Objective:** Build a website to teach computer science concepts with interactive coding exercises.
- **Target Audience:** Computer science students at various levels.

## 2. Team and Roles
- **Guilherme Barbosa:** Focus on Rust development for performance-critical backend services.
- **Pedro Lopes:** Handle Golang development for rapidly-developed, scalable services.
- **Possible Future Roles:** Frontend developer, content creator, QA tester.

## 3. Microservices Breakdown
- **User Management Service (Go):** Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
- **Content Delivery Service (Rust):** Manages tutorials, articles, and educational content.
- **Exercise and Compiler Service (Rust):** Deals with coding exercises, code compilation, and execution.
- **Database Service (Go/Rust):** Manages database interactions for user data and content.
- **API Gateway (Go):** Central entry point for managing and routing requests to appropriate services.

## 4. Initial Project Phases
### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
- Define functional and non-functional requirements for each service.
- Identify key features for the initial launch.

### Phase 2: System Design
- Outline the architecture for each microservice.
- Design database schemas and API contracts.

### Phase 3: Development Environment Setup
- Set up version control (Git) and repository structure.
- Configure Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

## 5. Development Roadmap
### Sprint 1: Basic User Management and Authentication
- Develop a basic user registration and login system.

### Sprint 2: Content Delivery System
- Implement basic CRUD operations for content.

### Sprint 3: Basic Exercise and Compiler System
- Develop a simple code editor and compiler integration.

### Sprint 4: Frontend Development Kickoff
- Start building the user interface for content viewing and coding exercises.

### Sprint 5 and Beyond: Iterative Development
- Continue developing and refining features based on initial framework.

## 6. Quality Assurance and Testing
- Implement unit and integration testing for each service.
- Plan for user acceptance testing to gather feedback.

## 7. Deployment and Continuous Integration
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Plan for initial deployment and testing in a staging environment.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting systems.
- Establish a process for regular updates and maintenance.

## 9. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for the development process and architecture.
- Regularly update documentation to reflect changes and updates.
